## Skipped Sources

The following classes are intentionally excluded from this archive:

- `C:\Users\Administrator\.codex\skills\.system`
- `C:\Users\Administrator\.codex\plugins\cache`
- `openai-bundled` plugin skills
- `openai-curated` plugin skills
- plugin cache, runtime, dependency, marketplace, and generated install directories

## Notes

- `D:\AI\skill` is the canonical maintenance location for these user-created skills.
- `C:\Users\Administrator\.codex\skills` keeps only the Codex discovery entries for these skills, as junctions pointing back to `D:\AI\skill`.
- Previous entries and obsolete duplicate sources were moved to `D:\AI\skill-migration-backups\20260527-112423`.
- Do not add loose skill files directly under `D:\AI\skill`; each skill must live in its own folder containing `SKILL.md`.
